# ðŸ’€ Rock-Paper-Scissors: DEATH Edition ðŸŽ®

Welcome to **Rock-Paper-Scissors DEATH**, a high-stakes twist on the classic game â€” where each wrong move brings you closer to elimination. 

This game started as an idea I wanted to bring to life, and with the help of AI tools, I built a working prototype in Python. Iâ€™m still early in my coding journey, and while I didnâ€™t write every line myself at first, Iâ€™ve been learning to understand and improve it piece by piece.

This is my first game project â€” and my goal is to fully make it mine. Iâ€™m now working on turning it into a 2D game using **Pygame**, learning how to add graphics, sound, and deploy it online.

## ðŸ’¡ Game Features

- 5 Survival Stages
- Sudden death mechanics with chance-based elimination
- Disqualification rules for invalid inputs
- Optional Final Gamble with 600x prize
- Dark theme inspired by high-risk games

## ðŸš§ In Progress

- Rewriting game logic into visual 2D interface (Pygame)
- Adding buttons, images, and music
- Deploying online (itch.io or playable browser version)

## ðŸ“š What I'm Learning

- Python game loops and event handling
- Pygame UI (text, images, sound)
- Git + GitHub version control
- Deploying indie games to the web

## ðŸ™Œ Contributions & Feedback

If you're a developer, gamer, or just curious â€” feel free to leave feedback, suggestions, or fork it and make your own version!

## ðŸ“œ Credits

- Built using Python + AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- Inspired by game shows and survival dramas
